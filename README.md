## Overview of Projects

### snow-forecasting

Collecting, cleaning, and merging daily snowfall time series data from various mountainous weather stations in the western US. Raw data reports were obtained from the Deparment of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service API (https://wcc.sc.egov.usda.gov/reportGenerator/). The goal of this project is to predict the spring snow melt date using only information from the onset of the previous winter up to the peak snow accumulation. Personally, I am interested in these predictions to more reliably plan snow-free backpacking trips. However, in industry the same information could be used by ski resorts to predict the optimal time to change their lift chairs to catch the beginning of the summer mountain biking season.
